no, Function signatures include the function name and parameters.

ex 1.9
1)int
2)float
3)The signature of the function invocation does not agree with that of either of the abc functions. 
  Since type conversions from both float to int and int to float are possible, 
  C++ cannot resolve which function to use and gives a compile-time error.
4)The actual parameters are of type double.
  C++ cannot resolve which function to use and gives a compile-time error as type conversions 
  from double to both int and float are possible.
